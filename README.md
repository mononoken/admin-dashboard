## General Information

This project is the final project of the intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project. It is an exercise in using various HTML and CSS tools, but it most notably focuses on Grid. There are many nested grids throughout the page. I have also used Flexbox, for example in the "Announcements" card.
